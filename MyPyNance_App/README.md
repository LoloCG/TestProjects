# About
Based mainly in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DXxQV47jOU&)

# Guide
Mostly follow the tutorial.

At one point the resource file generated needs to be converted into python using the following terminal command:
    
    'pyside6-rcc MW_Resources.qrc -o MW_Resources_rc.py'

## Changes from the youtube tutorial
I have used the expansion button both in the expanded and in the contracted sidebar. This requires setting one as toggled, and then in the main.py file to set up initial state of the sidebar.
