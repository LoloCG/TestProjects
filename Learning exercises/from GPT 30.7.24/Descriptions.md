1. Analyzing a Sales Dataset

Project Description: Analyze sales data to find trends, seasonality, and make forecasts.

Example Steps:

    Load the sales dataset using pandas.
    Perform data cleaning (e.g., handle missing values, correct data types).
    Analyze sales trends over different time periods (e.g., monthly, yearly).
    Identify top-performing products.
    Visualize sales trends using matplotlib.


2. Exploring a Movie Ratings Dataset

Project Description: Explore and analyze a movie ratings dataset to understand viewer preferences and trends.

Example Steps:

    Load the movie ratings dataset using pandas.
    Clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, correct data types).
    Calculate average ratings for each movie.
    Identify the most and least popular movies based on the number of ratings.
    Visualize the distribution of ratings using matplotlib.


3. Analyzing a Weather Dataset

Project Description: Analyze historical weather data to identify patterns and extreme weather events.

Example Steps:

    Load the weather dataset using pandas.
    Clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, correct data types).
    Analyze temperature trends over time.
    Identify extreme weather events (e.g., hottest and coldest days).
    Visualize temperature trends using matplotlib.


4. Customer Segmentation using E-commerce Data

Project Description: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Example Steps:

    Load the e-commerce dataset using pandas.
    Perform data cleaning (e.g., handle missing values, correct data types).
    Analyze purchasing patterns (e.g., frequency, monetary value).
    Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers.
    Visualize customer segments using matplotlib.


5. Stock Market Analysis

Project Description: Analyze stock market data to identify trends and make predictions.


Example Steps:

    Load the stock market dataset using pandas.
    Clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, correct data types).
    Analyze stock prices over time.
    Calculate key metrics (e.g., moving averages).
    Visualize stock price trends and metrics using matplotlib
