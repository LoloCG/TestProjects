'''
About: This file will serve as a module, and in the future as class, etc, to handle all interactions between the script and the database, from creation, to access and manipulation of data.

MVP:
    - Do slight pre cleaning of data from the .csv file 
        (conver date format, convert "," to "." for numbers, separate categories of subjects...)
    - Create a SQLite DB from the file of AbstractSpoon's ToDoList
    - Allow external functions access and manipulation of the db
